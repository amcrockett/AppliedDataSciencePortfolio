Purpose, Process, Product

We have built everything from net present value and internal rate of return calculators to extreme market event indicators, optimal portfolios, and risk-based capital: all set against the stylized facts of market risk and return. The final project puts it all together for a business context and data set of your choice.

Problem:

Cryptocurrencies first came in to existence in 2009 when bitcoin launched their open source software. Cryptocurrency has multiple advantages. They are encrypted for safe internet transactions and use decentralized control usually using blockchain. With the financial crash of 2008, people were looking to invest in a commodity that was more decentralized away from bank control. For about four years, Bitcoin’s value increased dramatically. Many early purchasers of bitcoin became wealthy from their investiment. Then bitcoin crashed in 2013. People who invested in the trend in 2012 and 2013 ended up losing thousands of dollars. Since then, many more cryptocurrencies have emerged and Bitcoin has recovered in the market place. There are people and businesses that believe cryptocurrency will be way of the future.

For this project, I am consulting for a small business interested in entering to the cryptocurrency market. The would like to know how risky is cryptocurrency and how likely would they be to get a return on their investiment. I will begin to build a comprehensive financial project by comparing three cryptocurrencies; bitcoin, ethereum, and ripple.

Tasks: 
1. Examine the volatily of each cryptocurrencies 
2. Retrieve and begin to analyze data about potential commodities to diversify into 
3. Begin to generate economic scenarios based on events that may, or may not, materialize in the commodities 
4. Mitigate their risks by diversifying in Cryptocurrency 
5. Identify the optimal combination of Bitcoin, Ethereun, and Ripple to trade.
