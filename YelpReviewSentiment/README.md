Overview:

Yelp, in efforts to enhance their data analysis, has made datasets public for data users to provide new prospective on the analysis process. One of the current challenges was to perform sentiment analysis on the review data. The data was subset to only include restaurant review. Sentiment Analysis was performed on the Yelp reviews and compared to the star ratings. The average delta between stars and normalized polarity was .761, indicated that on average the sentiment analysis was in within one star of the true customer rating. Our average overestimate was 1.056 and our underestimate 0.799, meaning sentiment analysis was more likely to skew positive when compared to star ratings. Almost all the most congruent star and polarity come from zip code 61820. This postal code belongs to Champaign County, Illinois. The least congruent stars and polarity have more variety, but most originate near Las Vegas, NV and Scottsdale, AZ.
