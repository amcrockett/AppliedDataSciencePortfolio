## Portfolio Overview

Data science is a broad field of study that includes a multitude of techniques to create meaning from data. The need for data
science is growing with 2.7 Zettabytes of data in the digital ether. The problem with most of this data is that it is in unstructured, making analysis difficult. Data Science provides methods for creating structure for these unstructured data points. With structured data, analyses are possible. Data analysis provides a path for making informed decisions based on data. Data is meaningless without analysis and interpretation of the analysis. The multitude of data and the ability to discover new insights is what drew me to data science.

While data science is a broad field of practice, certain skills are indispensable to be an effectual data scientist. Data
scientists much have firm knowledge of the major practice areas of data science. Data scientists must be well-versed in data collection
and organization. The value of data scientists is demonstrated through the ability of identifying meaningful patterns within the data and
developing alternative strategies informed by the data. Data scientists are integral in the role of business plan development as it
related to implementing business decisions derived from analyses. Data scientists need to demonstrate effective communication skills in
order to engage audiences with high-level outcome reporting. Lastly, data scientists must be concerned with the ethical dimensions of the
field to provide sound advisement when implementing data protocols. To demonstrate the above learning objectives, I have selected five 
projects from my Master's in Applied Data Science program. The projects below are listed chronologically.
